# AdventOfCode

These are my solutions for the 2022 edition of AdventOfCode!

I am using Elixir to get a taste of FP and I just really enjoy the language in general. We'll see how far I get this year....

### Info:
- code is in `lib/`, base helper funcs are in `lib/advent_of_code.ex`
- did some warmup on 2021 days
- the 2022 days will be in `lib/advent_of_code/dec{01...25}.ex`
- tests are in `test/advent_of_code_test.exs`, which are just macroe'd (is that even a word) checks for each part of each day.

---

I write a test with my expected output, so just run `mix test` to run the tests. If you want to see how long each day takes just run `mix test --trace`
